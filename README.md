MegaForge
=========

A savegame editor for Capcom's "Mega Man" series of classic platformers. The games covered here actually used a password system, but those passwords encoded the game state and can thus be generated.

The ultimate form of the project will be an interactive web page that lets you select the relevant accomplishments; it will start with the documentation of the formats (currently in algorithms.txt).
