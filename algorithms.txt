Mega Man II
-----------
There are 9 red dots to be placed on a 5x5 matrix.  One indicates the
number of energy tanks; this goes in the "A" row, with A1 being zero
energy tanks and A5 being four.

Each other dot indicates whether the status of a robot.  The codes
appear to change when the number of energy tanks change; however, 
increasing the number of tanks by one simply bumps each dot to the
right one notch.  Bumping a dot off the edge of the array moves it to
the next row down; bumping a dot off E5 moves it to B1.

The chart below ignores this and provides the information as a table.
A dot in the first coordinate indicates this robot has been beaten; a
dot in the parenthesized location indicates that it has not yet been
defeated.

Item 1 comes free with Heat Man; item 2 with Air Man, and item 3 with
Flash Man.

                          Number of Tanks
Robot          0        1        2        3        4
-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
Heat Man   | B2(D5) | B3(E1) | B4(E2) | B5(E3) | C1(E4) |
Quick Man  | B4(C4) | B5(C5) | C1(D1) | C2(D2) | C3(D3) |
Flash Man  | C1(E4) | C2(E5) | C3(B1) | C4(B2) | C5(B3) |
Crash Man  | C5(E2) | D1(E3) | D2(E4) | D3(E5) | D4(B1) |
Bubble Man | D1(C3) | D2(C4) | D3(C5) | D4(D1) | D5(D2) |
Wood Man   | D3(B5) | D4(C1) | D5(C2) | E1(C3) | E2(C4) |
Air Man    | E3(D2) | E4(D3) | E5(D4) | B1(D5) | B2(E1) |
Metal Man  | E5(E1) | B1(E2) | B2(E3) | B3(E4) | B4(E5) |
-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The ultimate password is thus A5 B24 C135 D45 E2.

Mega Man III
------------
One red dot indicates the number of E-tanks that you have, from zero
to nine, like so:

0: C5; 1: E6; 2: E4; 3: B4; 4: A5
5: C1; 6: D2; 7: C3; 8: F2; 9: A6

The robots are organized in pairs.  In each pair one is "dominant"
and one is "recessive."  If only one of the two has been beaten there
will be a red dot at the listed location.  If both have been beaten
there will be a blue dot at the dominant robot's location.

Example: Top Man is the dominant robot of the Top Man/Snake Man pair.
If Snake Man is beaten before Top Man, there is a red dot at F6.  If
you then beat Top Man, it becomes a blue dot at A3.  If you instead
beat Top Man first, you would have a red dot at A3 that turned blue
when you beat Snake Man.

In the chart below, the first robot listed on each row is the
dominant robot.

Basic Robots

Top Man:    A3 -- Snake Man:  F6
Spark Man:  F4 -- Shadow Man: D6
Needle Man: D3 -- Magnet Man: F5
Gemini Man: B5 -- Hard Man:   C4

Docbots

Spark Man:  A1 -- Shadow Man: A4
Needle Man: B2 -- Gemini Man: B6

Put a red dot on E1 to defeat Break Man.

Note that Mega Man III is somewhat unique in that it "sanity checks"
your passwords; if a Docbot is marked as beaten when all the basic
robots haven't been, this invalidates the password.  Likewise, a red
dot at E1 invalidates any password that isn't for the Wily stage.

E-tanks aren't checked; the password Red A6 will start the game "from
scratch" except for the minor detail that you now have 9 E-tanks.  Of
course, it's possible (though tedious) to do this honestly.

The ultimate code for Mega Man III is:
Red: A6 E1
Blue: A13 B25 D3 F4

Mega Man IV
-----------
Mega Man IV's password system is somewhat simplified from Mega Man
III's because it no longer keeps track of E-tanks; however, the
password validates itself, making random guessing of passwords
effectively impossible (unlike Mega Man III).

There are six red dots in Mega Man IV's password; four of them
indicate the status of the robots, one indicates the special devices
you have acquired, and the final dot is a "checksum" and depends on
how many devices, total, you have acquired.

The charts below are organized by dot, each of which governs two
devices.  After these five dots have been selected, choose the
correct location for the checksum dot.

The ultimate code for Mega Man IV is A14 B5 E2 F13.

+-------------+----+    
| Neither     | A2 |    Checksum codes:
| Toad Man    | B1 |    
| Bright Man  | C2 |    0: F5

Mega Man V
----------
One of the more involved password systems, Mega Man V crams twice as
much information into each dot than any earlier system.

There are three red dots and three blue dots in the Mega Man V
password.  Each red dot gives the status of three robots.  Each blue
dot gives the status of the three letters on those robot's stages.

The charts below group the robots and their letters.  To construct a
password, first choose which robots have been defeated.  Place the
three red dots in the unparenthesized locations given by the chart.

Example: You wish to have defeated Gravity Man, Stone Man, and 
Napalm Man.  You choose X _ X from group 1 (A6), _ _ _ from group 2
(D3), and _ X _ from group 3 (E2).

Now select the letters you wish to have obtained.  Place the blue
dots in the unparenthesized locations if possible; otherwise place
them in the parenthesized location.  (There is some overlap within a
group because of these; this is OK because if it shows up there it
signifies the same thing as the corresponding red dot from its
group.)

Continuing the example above: We want to have every letter except E.
A6 is already occupied, so we put a blue dot at D6 instead.  Then we
put blue dots at D4 and C1 and we're done.

The ultimate password for Mega Man V is:
RED: C1 D4 F6; BLUE: B4 D6 F1

Group 1: Gravity Man - Wave Man   - Stone Man   : M - E - G
Group 2: Gyro Man    - Star Man   - Charge Man  : A - M - A
Group 3:               Napalm Man - Crystal Man :     N - V

Pattern | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 |
--------+---------+---------+---------+
 _ _ _  | F5 (E5) | D3 (B3) | B1 (F1) |
 _ _ X  | B5 (D5) | F3 (C3) | D2 (A2) |
 _ X _  | B6 (E6) | F4 (C4) | E2 (A2) |
 _ X X  | C5 (D5) | A3 (C3) | C1 (F1) |
 X _ _  | C6 (E6) | A4 (C4) |         |
 X _ X  | A6 (D6) | E4 (B4) |         |
 X X _  | A5 (E5) | E3 (B3) |         |
 X X X  | F6 (D6) | D4 (B4) |         |
--------+---------+---------+---------+

Mega Man VI
-----------
Unique among the games, Mega Man VI's passwords are nondeterministic;
there are between two and thirty-two different ways to represent a
given level of progress.

There are four completely different code systems used in Mega Man VI.
The lower foursquare (E5-E6, F5-F6) has a single dot in it to 
indicate which code is being used.  The E6 and F5 codes are used if
you do not have the Energy Economizer; the E5 and F6 codes are used
if you do.

The four dots indicating defeat of the robots works essentially the
same way as in Mega Man IV, except there is no checksum.  Furthermore
if you have obtained Beat parts you have a choice of two places to
put your dot.  I have not been able to determine any difference
between these locations, and you can mix and match to your heart's
content.

Mega Man VI does *not* sanity check your passwords; you always need
some Rush adaptions to get Beat-Parts or the Energy Economizer, but
you can happily enter A15 C5 E15 and start the game with the
Economizer; a good trick since you can't get it without Rush Power,
which you can't get without beating Flame Man.  You can also hand
yourself Beat Parts without the Rush Adaptations needed to reach
them.

An ultimate code for Mega Man VI is A4 C26 E45.

Mega Man VII
------------
Unlike the previous (or, for that matter, later) games in the series,
Mega Man 7 stores a *lot* of state. Most previous games in the series
ended up storing on the order of 10-12 bits of information; MM7 stores
46, not counting its check bits.

These bits are stored in a 4x4 grid of numbers from 1 to 8.  This
gives us 3 bits per number and 2 spare bits for error
correction/verification. The password starts from a base
state---8735-2527-4416-8362, as it happens---and then things
you acquire or accomplish will flip bits in this number. The result is
then coerced into the 1-8 range.  (It's easiest to think of this as
meaning that "8" is secretly "0".)

Several numerical quantities tracked in the game: Bolts, E-Tanks,
W-Tanks, and Beat Whistles. Bolts go from 0-999 (9 bits) and the
others go from 0-4 (3 bits). These are stored as ordinary binary
numbers. (Compare the earlier games, which effectively used a unary
system to indicate E-Tank count.)

The password "checksum" is two remaining bits that must be a certain
value depending on how many other bits were flipped. (That means that
having 127 bolts counts as seven bits worth of impact, but having 128
only counts as one.) I call these two bits "check bit 1" and "check
bit 2", and treat them as bits that can hold a value between 0 and
3. To determine whether or not these bits should be flipped in the
password, count up the number of all other bits flipped. As the number
of bits increases, the pattern for the parity value is 0, 1, 0, 3, 2,
1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0... and so on.

The more computery way to do that is to say "If the number of bits
flipped is 0 or less, then that is your value. Otherwise, subtract
the number from 2 and apply a bitmask of 0x03 to the result."

The password checker will also make a perfunctory effort to ensure
that you have not asked the game to start in an impossible situation,
but as we will see, it doesn't try very hard.

HOW TO GENERATE A PASSWORD

We number the password squares in row-major order, like so:

                            +--+--+--+--+
                            | 0| 1| 2| 3|
                            +--+--+--+--+
                            | 4| 5| 6| 7|
                            +--+--+--+--+
                            | 8| 9|10|11|
                            +--+--+--+--+
                            |12|13|14|15|
                            +--+--+--+--+

For each change to the password, we represent that as a pair (n, b)
where n is the number of the square to flip (as counted above) and b
is the bit to flip (1, 2, or 4). You will XOR the value in the square
by b to make the change.

  Opening Stage: 6, 2

The first level. Whether or not you impress Bass is not recorded. You
need to have cleared it to get any other powers.

  Cloud Man:   1, 4
  Burst Man:   7, 1
  Junk Man:    8, 4
  Freeze Man: 10, 4

The Tier 1 robots. Marking all four of these but none of the following
ones will start you in the Robot Museum stage.

  Robot Museum: 10, 1

Marking this as beaten unlocks the Tier 2 robots. There is NOT a check
to see whether you cleared all four Tier 1 robots here, so you can put
the game in an impossible state here if you want.

  Tier 2 Enabled: 1, 1

This bit can only be set if Robot Museum is completed, and it must be
set in order to select any of the Tier 2 robots below.

  Spring Man:  4, 1
  Shade Man:   5, 1
  Slash Man:  13, 2
  Turbo Man:  15, 1

  All Robots:  4, 4

If you have selected all 8 robots as beaten, you must also set the
"All Robots" bit. Otherwise the game will put you at the robot select
menu and will not unlock the Dr. Wily stage. Even an EXIT canister
will not get you back on track, but doing a full traversal of an
already-beaten level will.

Collectibles

These are basically the things you see on the second screen on the
pause menu.

R-U-S-H Letters:

  R: 14, 1
  U:  9, 4
  S:  0, 4
  H:  6, 4

Bolts:

  512 bolts:  5, 4
  256 bolts:  2, 2
  128 bolts:  0, 1
   64 bolts: 14, 4
   32 bolts: 12, 2
   16 bolts:  5, 2
    8 bolts: 11, 4
    4 bolts:  8, 2
    2 bolts:  2, 4
    1 bolt:   4, 2

Tanks:

  4 W-Tanks:  3, 4
  2 W-Tanks:  3, 1
  1 W-Tank:   7, 2

  4 E-Tanks: 15, 4
  2 E-Tanks:  9, 1
  1 E-Tank:  13, 1

  S-Tank:    12, 4

Beat:

  Beat Rescued:  9, 2
  4 Whistles:    3, 2
  2 Whistles:    2, 1
  1 Whistle:    10, 2

It's legal to give yourself whistles without having rescued Beat, but
they won't show up in your inventory, nor will they work. The verifier
does not check to confirm that you've met the prequisites for rescuing
Beat, so you can give yourself working whistles in the first level and
it will be fine with that.

There are maxima of 999 bolts and 4 W-Tanks, E-Tanks, or Beat
Whistles.

Miscellaneous:

  Exit:      15, 2
  E-Balancer: 1, 2
  Power-Up:  12, 1
  HyperBolt: 13, 4

  Delivered HyperBolt: 11, 2

Hilariously, "Delivered HyperBolt" does not require actually having
the HyperBolt; Auto will greet you as if you had been there before and
will have the full selection and the discount.

Miscellaneous Powers:

  Rush Jet:      0, 2
  Rush Search:  11, 1
  Suit Adapter: 14, 2
  Protoshield:   7, 4

The Protoshield requires you to have Tier 2 enabled. No other powers have precondition checks.

Check bits:

  Check bit 1: 6, 1
  Check bit 2: 8, 1

As described at the start, if x is the number of bits you
flipped above, the check value is given by the formula

      0           if x is 0
     (2-x) & 3    otherwise

SO YOU JUST WANT EVERYTHING

Getting everything doesn't involve flipping all the bits, because that
would involve 7 E-Tanks, 1023 bolts, and other maxima being exceeded.

Maxing everything out and doing everything yields the code
7853-5842-2245-7515.
